/*Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, 
as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.*/
-- You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

SELECT city, LENGTH(city) As Len -- length of city name
FROM station
ORDER BY Len, city -- ordering from short to long and alphabetical order of city name since there is length of city name more than one
LIMIT 1; -- choosing the top 1 from the indicated order

SELECT city, LENGTH(city) As Len
FROM station
ORDER BY Len DESC -- ordering from long to short and no city with the same length for the longest
LIMIT 1;  -- choosing the top 1 from the indicated order
