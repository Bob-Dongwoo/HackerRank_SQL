/* Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, 
but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), 
and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), 
and round it up to the next integer. */

-- The input table shows the actual salry table. The error can be calculated by replacing 0 to an empty space. 
-- The type of data does not change with replace function. After replacing it calculate the average and subtract it from the actual average
-- CEIL is used to calculated the rounded up to the next integer
SELECT CEIL(AVG(salary) - AVG(REPLACE(salary, 0, ''))) 
FROM employees
