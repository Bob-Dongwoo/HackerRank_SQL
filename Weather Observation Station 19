/* Consider P1(a, b) and P2(c, d) to be two points on a 2D plane where (a, b) are the respective minimum and maximum values of 
Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and (c, d) are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.
Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits. /*

-- Euclidean Distance is the square root of sum of the square of the difference in x axis and y axis

SELECT ROUND(
